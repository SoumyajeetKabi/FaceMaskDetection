# Face Mask Detection in Image using Azure Custom Vision
## Problem Statement
Because of the advent of COVID19 pandemic, the use of Face Mask in public places has become a prime importance to stop the spread the virus. Though, our government has taken the initiative to restrict and penalize people who are walking in public places without wearing mask, still a shortcoming remains because of manually handling the procedure. If the process could have been automated using Artificial Intelligence, then it would ease the process as a whole and also ensure the safety of others during pandemic.
## Solution
I developed a solution that will detect whether a person is wearing face mask or not using Azure Custom Vision. The solution uses the concept of Azure Custom Vision to correctly classify images of people who are wearing mask with an accuracy percentage. This is to ensure, that a low accuracy percentage means that the person is not wearing mask, and further necessary action can be taken by competent authority, Further, the solution was deployed as a web application using Azure Static Web App to make it available for public use.
